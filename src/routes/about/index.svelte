					<span>This is an easy one.</span> <br>
					I made a website with squarespace for my family's business but I had a few issues with it.
					Cards not being the same height, weird font bugs etc. And I had no knowledge of how to
					solve these problems.
				</p>
				<p>That's it. I was basically annoyed with Squarespace and myself.</p>
				<p>
					Then I saw a
					<a href="https://cognosis.co.uk/">minimal website</a>
					built by a small web design and development agency,
					<a href="https://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built By Buffalo</a>, and that's when obsession hit. The possibilities seemed endless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Long story short, I started learning the basics in mid 2020 in my free time whilst working
					2 finance jobs. What was an interest quickly became an obsession.

				<p>
					<strong>
						A passionate developer fixated on always learning and getting you the best result.
					</strong>
					I turned an interest into an obsession and I learn this stuff for fun in my spare time.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A systemic thinker who craves readability and scalability of code.</strong>
					One of my key interests is systemising and ordering my code over time. This is partially
					why I enjoy working with CSS and, as of late, components.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A team player who wants to teach and learn from others.</strong>
					Whilst I haven't coded with others and I already can imagine it's a difficult task, I have
					reviewed code of others and have given constructive feedback when asked. I have also
					developed better social skills through working in sales as well as my finance-analyst role
					which includes/d stakeholder management (build bridges instead of burning them).
