					<br />
					I made a website with squarespace for my family's business but I had a few issues with it.
					Cards not being the same height, weird font bugs etc. And I had no knowledge of how to
					solve these problems.
				</p>
				<p>That's it. I was basically annoyed with Squarespace and myself.</p>
				<p>
					Then I saw a
					<a href="https://cognosis.co.uk/">minimal website</a>
					built by a small web design and development agency,
					<a href="https://builtbybuffalo.com/">Built By Buffalo</a>
					, and that's when obsession hit. The possibilities seemed endless.
				</p>
				<p>
					Long story short, I started learning the basics in mid 2020 in my free time whilst working
					2 finance jobs. What was an interest quickly became an obsession.

						<strong>
							A passionate developer fixated on always learning and getting you the best result.
						</strong>
						I turned an interest into an obsession and I learn this stuff for fun in my spare time.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>A systemic thinker who craves readability and scalability of code.</strong>
						One of my key interests is systemising and ordering my code over time. This is partially
						why I enjoy working with CSS and, as of late, components.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>A team player who wants to teach and learn from others.</strong>
						Whilst I haven't coded with others and I already can imagine it's a difficult task, I
						have reviewed code of others and have given constructive feedback when asked. I have
						also developed better social skills through working in sales as well as my
						finance-analyst role which includes/d stakeholder management (build bridges instead of
						burning them).

					<strong>
						A passionate developer fixated on always learning and getting you the best result.
					</strong>
					I turned an interest into an obsession and I do this stuff for fun in my spare time. Making a website for someone else simply makes it a stronger motivation for me to push myself for.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>A systemic thinker who distils information and provides an accurate solution.</strong>
					I use my character trait of distiling information to a singular vision for the benefit of my clients. I narrow down the exact need and provide an exact solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Straight shooter.</strong>
					I have 1 objective: deliver the best possible website to you that I can craft. I will only accept to work with someone if I truly believe I can help them. If the project is outside of my skillset and problem solving abilities or expertise, my personal ethics simply won't allow me to accept the job. Am I'm a realistic at heart - knowing what I can and can't do is somewhat of a personal expertise.
