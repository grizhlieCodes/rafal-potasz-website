# My personal website

Hello! Welcome to my first personal website. It was a blast designing and
building this. It has been a while since I've finished v1 and at this point I
feel like changing everything (rebuilding a better site)!

## Thoughts

I wish I used TailwindCSS. Back then I still struggled with liking Tailwind. It
took a few months for me to warm up to it and the primary reason for loving it
is that it is SO FAST to build with. The second reason for loving Tailwind is
that most CSS issues dissapear when you're working with a utility-class system.
Sure the HTML doesn't look pretty but pretty HTML is not worth the
time-sacrefice of CSS maintainance I think. And when you're building components
it really is not that bad.

I plan to start designing and building my new brand and website in June-2022.
Stay tuned :)
